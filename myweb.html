    Hi! This is Issac To, a  first year student majoring in computer science at King's Collge London.
    I aspired to become a technology consultant as I am very interested in emerging technologies such as AI, Blockchain and Cloud Computing and would love to see how these technologies could "disrupt" the business sector.

    Singing in the school choir has long been one of my extracurricular activities. During high school, I sang in the school senior choir, senior mixed choir and madrigal. I was really glad that in form five.
    I got the golden opportunity to serve as the vice chairman of the school's intermediate. The link above would lead you to 2018 Homecoming Concert, where I conducted the intermediate choir. Please feel free to click the
    button and take a look at it;)

    I have been passionate about Taekwando since primary school. I am now a second-stage black belt holder. In 2018 Decemeber, to my surprise, I won the Tuen Mun Yan Ai Taekwando Copmetition. Although I did not play for my
    university's team in my first year, I look forward to joining the team in the coming years.
