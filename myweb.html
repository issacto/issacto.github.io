    Hi! This is Issac To, a  first year student majoring in computer science at King's Collge London.
    I aspired to become a technology consultant as I am very interested in emerging technologies such as AI, Blockchain and Cloud Computing and would love to see how these technologies could "disrupt" the business sector.

    I graduated from Diocesan Boys' School in 2019. I am very grateful for the things that i've learnt from my teachers, counsellors and peers at this school.

          Singing in the school choir has long been one of my extracurricular activities.
    <br> During high school, I sang in the school senior choir, senior mixed choir and madrigal. I was really glad that in form five.
    I got the golden opportunity to serve as the vice chairman of the school's intermediate. The link above would lead you to 2018 Homecoming Concert, where I conducted the intermediate choir. Please feel free to click the
    button and take a look at it;)

    <br> I am now a chorsier at King's College London and I really hope to rejoin the choir after the virus.

    <br><br>  I am also very forunate that I have met friends that are so enthusiatic about acapella. We've formed the acapella group Aka Harmonic and performed in Ted talk and wedding event.

    I have been passionate about Taekwando since primary school and am now a second-stage black belt holder. In 2018 Decemeber, I won the Tuen Mun Yan Ai Taekwando Competition. Although I did not play for my
    university's team in my first year, I look forward to joining the team in the coming years.
